# GameHostBot
The discord com.team3m.bot.controller is built on JDA.
The com.team3m.bot.controller can host party-games, such as Mafia, Coup, Secret Spy, Who Am I?.

This project is a course work at the subject "Advanced Sofware Engineering" at AAU.

The com.team3m.bot.controller will have monolithic architecture. If project will get too big or too many games will be added, it is likely to alter to microservices architecture.

Software development process â€” Test-driven development.

REAME is still in development.
