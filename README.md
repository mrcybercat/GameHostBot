# GameHostBot
The discord bot is built on JDA.
The bot can host party-games, such as Mafia, Coup, Secret Spy, Who Am I?.

This project is a course work at the subject "Advanced Sofware Engineering" at AAU.

The bot will have monolithic architecture. If project will get too big or too many games will be added, it is likely to alter to microservices architecture.

Software development process â€” Test-driven development.

REAME is still in development.
